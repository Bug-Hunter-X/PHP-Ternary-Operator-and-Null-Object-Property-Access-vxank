This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to improper use of the ternary operator, particularly when dealing with null values.  The issue arises from the fact that the ternary operator's middle expression is evaluated regardless of whether the condition is true or false, leading to potential errors when attempting to access properties of a null object.

```php
<?php
class MyClass {
    public $property = 'some value';
}

$myObject = null;

$result = $myObject ? $myObject->property : 'default value';

echo $result;
?>
```

In this example, even though `$myObject` is null, PHP will still attempt to evaluate `$myObject->property`, resulting in a fatal error: `PHP Fatal error:  Cannot access property of non-object`.
